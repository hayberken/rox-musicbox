TODO items for MusicBox

* How to update settings only when OK is pressed?
(if enabled now it keeps trying to reload everything as you type the Library path)

* Add options for Remaining, Elapsed time and/or Percentage instead of just Remain.

* Add Edit id3 tags menu option? call out to Songer? Drag and drop to Songer?

* Support for large libraries (takes too long to load)

* Test (and fix I'm sure) graceful fallback for missing dependencies (e.g. no pyogg
	don't support ogg, but everything else should work.

* Mutiple selection support

* Delete songs from list

* Save list/selection as pls/m3u
