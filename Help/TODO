TODO items for MusicBox

* Add Edit id3 tags menu option? call out to Songer? Drag and drop to Songer?
* Multiple selection support
* Save playlist UI settings (column width, order, window size, etc.)
* Shuffle by Album, Artist
* Gtk 2.4 support (get rid of deprecation warnings)
  - Menu and Toolbars change to new UIManager spec.

* Native Alsa Mixer support (Done!)

* AAC (m4a, not iTunes m4p) playback support
 - This looks difficult!

* Separate Player/Playlist from UI so that player can keep playing if UI is 
closed. Essentially, I want a daemon process that just plays music from the
playlist, with an API for various UI.  I want to have the music keep playing
even if X dies.  I want to use dbus.

* Gtk 2.6 support
- use gtk.STOCK_ constants for Media buttons, but have it backward compatible.
