0.0.3
- Edited the Options.xml to have a big tooltip for the mp3 player explaining some things.
- Edited the README a bit (put MY email address in there instead of Thomas') giving some
	basic instructions.
- Changed mp3 player launching from os.popen2 to popen2.Popen3 so I can get 
	the pid and kill it later if necessary (for me it is needed for mpg123, otherwise
	the player never dies and runs at 100%)
- Initial value of mp3 player is now ''.  MusicBox now detects that at startup and 
	shows the Options dialog so you can specify your player.  (TODO: Need to detect
	failed player launch and inform the user to try again)
