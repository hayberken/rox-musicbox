MusicBox - an MP3/OGG Player for the ROX Desktop
by Ken Hayber

09-Dec-2003
0.0.11
- Preview Release of next version.  Looking for feedback.
- UI redesign (main window is like Gnome CD player, playlist window is a popup)
- Code refactoring.  Trying for a MVC design (UI->Playlist->Player->libraries(ID3/MAD/OGG)
- Playlist main store is an array now instead of a dictionary.  The dict is what caused
	the default 'sort order' to be other than your directory layout.
- Take advantage of Python 2.3 (currently only ossaudiodev support to enable the volume control)
- Fix: last version slowed down the playlist loading due to enabling the Artist column
	for sorting before the list was filled.  Man does that slow things down!
- New feature: Volume control if you are using Python 2.3 and OSS (or alsa oss emulation)
- New feature: The current playlist can be saved with all the tag info in an XML file
	called Library.xml in your Choices/MusicBox dir.  If this file exists then it will
	be loaded by default when starting.  This greatly speeds up load times for large
	collections.  I'm toying with the idea of making this file iTunes compatible. (I have
	an iBook and and iPod so there is incentive there for me)

	Note: the playlist in this version does very little now, but you can save the library
	from there using the right-click menu.  The main window is mostly complete.

0.0.10
- Bugfixes for python 2.3 support and misc. (thanks Ulrich)
- Added Track number and Comment tag display to the browser
- Added <track> regex tag for guess() function

10-Sept-2003
0.0.9
- Split out the playlist code to allow easier addition of stuff like filtering.
- Rudimentary filtering: single Artist, Album or Genre only for now.
- Added regex pattern for splitting the path/filename into artist/album/title.  This
	is used on initial load and when there is no tag information.  You can edit this
	pattern to match your preference for storing and naming your music.
- Added Spanish translation (thanks Nicolas)
- Refactored player.py to allow song-specific parameters to be passed into the ouput
	driver (fixed problems with mp3 sampled at 22050 instead of the more typical 44100)
- Automatically try linuxaudiodevice if ao fails to import. (not tested)
- Allow menu from right-click on song list (preparing for selection-specific menu)
- Fixed shuffle cache code (int_value not value)

1-Sept-2003
0.0.8

- Fixes for hangs that several people were reporting (need pygtk 1.99.17 or higher)
- Fix to prevent crash when using Seek bar with no song playing.
- Fixes for missing ogg, mad, ao handling.  Requires at least one of ogg/mad and requires
	ao to run.
- Added Shuffle cache to prevent replaying of songs too frequently in shuffle mode.
- Re-layout Options dialog.
- Load initial playlist based on directory structure (Artist/Album/Song), then load
	tag information in the background.  Should speed up initial loading for large
	playlists.  (Works well for me with ~400 songs via 802.11b wireless connection)


29-Aug-2003
0.0.7 (Version 0.0.6 wasn't very good)

- Rewrite player code to use pymad, pyogg, pyao directly.  No more MPG123/321.  This
	gives better control over the player and it now works correctly when using
	esd (you can hear your sound effects and notifications; e.g. 'you've got mail!')
- OGG!
- Playlist support (.pls and .m3u)
- Drag and Drop support - you can drag and drop folders, mp3, ogg, pls or m3u files
	onto MusicBox.  If you hold the Shift key these files will be added to the
	current list, otherwise the list will be replaced.  The result will be saved
	as the default.
- Moved remaining time and current song to the Title bar so that this information shows
	while iconized.
- Italian and Portugese (Brazil) translations (thanks to Yuri and Leandro) - but they
	need a couple of small updates.
- Decided that volume control was not going to happen, so I changed it to a Seek bar
	so that you can skip to any point in the song.  It also keeps moving while the
	song plays.

0.0.5
- Added support for multiple Music folders using ':' as separator (e.g. like PATH).
- Added support for drag and drop of folders into main window.  Dropped folder list
	replaces current library and is saved as the default.
- Loading library is now in a thread so window comes up faster and you can start playing
	before library is completely loaded (for those with large libraries).
- MAY have fixed the bug that some are seeing with mpg321/123 locking up when Stop or
	other buttons are pressed (I fixed a gtk threads issue, but since I have not
	seen the reported problem it may not be the same problem)
- Display song and remaining time on title bar so that minimized player still shows status.
	(This needs some work and should be optional I think)
- I received an Italian translation (thanks yuri), but it is not working.  Someone tell
	me what I'm doing wrong, please.

I've noticed that only ogg123 allows other sounds to be played when using esd.  This
kinda sucks.  I'm looking at doing all the playing in python (pyogg, pyao, pymad) to
see if that works any better.

0.0.4
- Added error handling for missing library path and missing mp3 player.
- Default mp3 player to none and show options dialog at first run.
- Removed 'Time' column for now because a) it was broken and b) when I fixed it it took
	WAY too long to load even my measly 300 song library.
- Fixed Shuffle to use time.time() as the Random() seed to that it is actually
	somewhat Random.
- Don't load mp3 player until needed (first step to supporting ogg)

0.0.3
- Edited the Options.xml to have a big tooltip for the mp3 player explaining some things.
- Edited the README a bit (put MY email address in there instead of Thomas') giving some
	basic instructions.
- Changed mp3 player launching from os.popen2 to popen2.Popen3 so I can get
	the pid and kill it later if necessary (for me it is needed for mpg123, otherwise
	the player never dies and runs at 100%)
- Initial value of mp3 player is now ''.  MusicBox now detects that at startup and
	shows the Options dialog so you can specify your player.  (TODO: Need to detect
	failed player launch and inform the user to try again)
