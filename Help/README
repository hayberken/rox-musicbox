MusicBox -
an MP3/OGG Player for the ROX Desktop
		by Ken Hayber

Brief
~~~~~
MusicBox plays your mp3 and ogg files.  It supports ogg via pyogg/libvorbis and
mp3 via pymad/libmad.

The latest version of MusicBox is at:

Instructions
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Extract the MusicBox appdir and copy it to wherever you normally put ROX apps.
Then launch it!  Initially it assumes that you put all your mp3 and/or ogg files
in ~/Music.

If these are not correct you must edit the Options to suit your setup.  For
library changes just hit the refresh button, unless you used Drag and Drop in which
case the display will update automatically.  If you have a lot of files it will
take considerable time to read them all - I'm working on this.  However, don't
let that stop you from hitting the play button!  We got threads man.


Tag Info and Filenames
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
MusicBox will try to read tag info from your files, but this can take a long time
and many files do not contain this information.  Therefore, MusicBox will first attempt
to 'guess' the artist, album and title from the filename and path of each song.
However this loading process is a background task.  You can start playing songs or
even quit MusicBox while this is happening.

The default assumption is artist/album/title.ext, but you can change this if you
need to.  In the Options dialog there is a Pattern field that provides a place to
edit the default pattern to be used. (Note: this is easy to get wrong and if you
create a pattern that fails to match properly the default will be used)  Currently
MusicBox only supports artist, album and title.

The default pattern looks like this:
	^.*/(?P<artist>.*)/(?P<album>.*)/(?P<title>.*)
This pattern throws away any leading path, and separates the rest as artist/album/title.
The <track> option is also available if you have track numbers as part of your file
naming scheme.


Dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~
MusicBox depends on pyao/libao for sound output, pymad/libmad for mp3 processing
and pyogg/libvorbis and friends for ogg support.

Current versions as of this writing are:
    pymad 0.4.1 (http://spacepants.org/src/pymad/)
    libmad 0.14.2 (http://www.underbit.com/products/mad/)
    pyogg, pyvorbis, libvorbis, libogg 1.0 (http://www.vorbis.com/download.psp)
    libao 0.8.3 (http://www.vorbis.com/download.psp)
    pyao  0.8 (http://www.vorbis.com/download.psp)
Optional:
	pyid3lib, id3lib (for ID3v2 tags!)

Hopefully your distro will provide packages for these, otherwise you will have to
download and build them from sources.

NOTE: I have discovered that pygtk before version 1.99.17 doesn't support threads all
that well, so you must have 1.99.17 or higher.  Sorry.
