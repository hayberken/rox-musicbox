MusicBox -
an MP3/OGG Player for the ROX Desktop
		by Ken Hayber

Brief
~~~~~
MusicBox plays your mp3 and ogg files.  It supports ogg via pyogg/libvorbis and
mp3 via pymad/libmad.

The latest version of MusicBox is at:

Instructions
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Extract the MusicBox appdir and copy it to wherever you normally put ROX apps.
Then launch it!  Initially it assumes that you put all your mp3 and/or ogg files
in ~/Music.

If these are not correct you must edit the Options to suit your setup.  For
library changes just hit the refresh button, unless you used Drag and Drop in which
case the display will update automatically.  If you have a lot of files it will
take considerable time to read them all - I'm working on this.  However, don't
let that stop you from hitting the play button!  We got threads man.

MusicBox depends on pyao/libao for sound output, pymad/libmad for mp3 processing
and pyogg/libvorbis and friends for ogg support.

Current versions as of this writing are:
    pymad 0.4.1 (http://spacepants.org/src/pymad/)
    libmad 0.14.2 (http://www.underbit.com/products/mad/)
    pyogg, pyvorbis, libvorbis, libogg 1.0 (http://www.vorbis.com/download.psp)
    libao 0.8.3 (http://www.vorbis.com/download.psp)
    pyao  0.8 (http://www.vorbis.com/download.psp)

Hopefully your distro will provide packages for these, otherwise you will have to
download and build them from sources.

NOTE: I have discovered that pygtk before version 1.99.17 doesn't support threads all
that well, so you must have 1.99.17 or higher.  Sorry.
