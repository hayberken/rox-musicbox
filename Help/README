			by Ken Hayber

Brief
~~~~~
MPG123 and MPG123 are existing mp3 players for the text console.  These players have a
remote control mode that allows them to be controlled by another application. MusicBox
is such an application.  MusicBox scans a directory structure and allows browsing and
playing of your music library.

The latest version of MusicBox is at:
