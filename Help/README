			MusicBox
			A Front-end to MPG123 and MPG321
			by Ken Hayber

Brief
~~~~~
MPG123 and MPG123 are existing mp3 players for the text console.  These players have a
remote control mode that allows them to be controlled by another application. MusicBox
is such an application.  MusicBox scans a directory structure and allows browsing and
playing of your music library.

The latest version of MusicBox is at:

Instructions
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Extract the MusicBox appdir and copy it to wherever you normally put ROX apps.
Then launch it!  Initially it assumes that you are using mpg321 and it is in 
your $PATH.  It also assumes you put all your mp3 files in ~/Music.

If these are not correct you must edit the Options to suit your setup.  For 
changes to the mp3 player you must currently restart the app for it to take 
effect (to be fixed later).  For library changes just hit the refresh button.

If you don't hear anything playing you first need to troubleshoot whether 
mpg123|321 is working for you normally.  MusicBox is just a controller for these.
You may need to get and build/install one of them first if your distribution
does not already have one installed.
